# Overview

The Sensu Web Dev project is a template for developing prototype web applications for [Sensu Go](https://sensu.io).
The primary objective of this project is to provide a simple local development environment for Sensu front end engineering skills assessments (i.e. technical job interviews).

# Goals

## User Stories

We need to build a application that allows our users to manage the entities within their Sensu installation.

- A user must be able to list the entities within their Sensu installation.
- A user must be able to sort the list of entities.
- A user must be able to filter the list of entities.
- A user must be able to delete entities.

To get you up and running quickly, we provide a simple base application that can connect to our GraphQL service. See below for setup instructions.

Despite the very minimal canvas to get started, you are free to use any means of state management, styling, or other patterns. There are no wrong answers, this portion of the interview process is your chance to flex your skills. Show us what you've got.

## Discussion

Be prepared to discuss,

- Describe the data structures you deem necassary while building the feature.
- Discuss how you've designed the interface to be ease to use.
- Discuss how you broke the problems down and tackled them.

Bonus

Visualize events associated with the entity. Or, other anything else you might find interesting, we love surprises.

## Time

Please try to timebox your efforts to two hours. If you don't finish that is okay; ultimately we want to understand thought process, your ability to discuss your work, and your overall skill level, not necassarily your ability to complete arbitrary tasks.

# Prerequisites

1. **Git**

   Please visit the [Git user documentation](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) for instructions on installing Git.

1. **Docker**

   Please visit the [Docker user documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for instructions on installing Docker.

1. **NodeJS & NPM**

   Please visit the [NodeJS Downloads page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) for instructions on installing NodeJS.

   _NOTE: please verify your NodeJS installation by running the `npm --version` command._

1. **Docker Compose (optional)**

   Please visit the [Docker user documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) for instructions on installing `docker-compose`.

## Setup

There are two ways to setup the Sensu Web Dev environment: manual installation (recommended for most users), and Docker Compose (only recommended if you're familiar with Docker Compose).

### Manual Installation

1. **Clone this repository.**

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/sensu/sensu-web-dev.git
   cd sensu-web-dev
   ```

1. **Download and start the Sensu Backend/API using Docker.**

   ```shell
   docker run -d --rm --name sensu-backend \
   -p 8080:8080 -p 3000:3000 \
   sensu/sensu:6.4.0 sensu-backend start
   ```

   _NOTE: if your Docker installation requires `root` user privileges, you may need to re-run this command with `sudo` (i.e. `sudo docker run ...`);
   Windows users may need to run `docker` commands in a shell with Administrator privileges._

   After completing this step you should be able to verify your install by visiting the Sensu web app at http://127.0.0.1:8080.

1. **Download and configure the Sensu CLI (`sensuctl`)**

   **Mac users:**

   ```shell
   # Download sensuctl
   export SENSU_VERSION="6.4.0"
   export SENSU_USERNAME="admin"
   export SENSU_PASSWORD="P@ssw0rd!"
   curl -LO "https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/sensu.io/sensu-go/${SENSU_VERSION}/sensu-go_${SENSU_VERSION}_darwin_amd64.tar.gz"
   sudo tar -xzf "sensu-go_${SENSU_VERSION}_darwin_amd64.tar.gz" -C /usr/local/bin/
   rm sensu-go_${SENSU_VERSION}_darwin_amd64.tar.gz
   # Configure sensuctl
   sensuctl configure --non-interactive --namespace default --api-url http://127.0.0.1:8080 --username ${SENSU_USERNAME} --password ${SENSU_PASSWORD}
   ```

   **Windows users (Powershell):**

   ```powershell
   # Download sensuctl
   ${Env:SENSU_VERSION}="6.4.0"
   ${Env:SENSU_USERNAME}="admin"
   ${Env:SENSU_PASSWORD}="P@ssword!"
   Invoke-WebRequest `
     -Uri "https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/sensu.io/sensu-go/${Env:SENSU_VERSION}/sensu-go_${Env:SENSU_VERSION}_windows_amd64.zip" `
     -OutFile "${Env:UserProfile}\sensu-go_${Env:SENSU_VERSION}_windows_amd64.zip"
   Expand-Archive `
     -LiteralPath "${Env:UserProfile}\sensu-go_${Env:SENSU_VERSION}_windows_amd64.zip" `
     -DestinationPath "${Env:UserProfile}\Sensu\bin"
   ${Env:Path} += ";${Env:UserProfile}\Sensu\bin"
   # Configure sensuctl
   sensuctl configure --non-interactive --namespace default --api-url http://127.0.0.1:8080 --username ${Env:SENSU_USERNAME} --password ${Env:SENSU_PASSWORD}
   ```

   **Linux users:**

   ```shell
   # Download sensuctl
   export SENSU_VERSION="6.4.0"
   export SENSU_USERNAME="admin"
   export SENSU_PASSWORD="P@ssw0rd!"
   curl -LO "https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/sensu.io/sensu-go/${SENSU_VERSION}/sensu-go_${SENSU_VERSION}_linux_amd64.tar.gz" && \
   sudo tar -xzf "sensu-go_${SENSU_VERSION}_linux_amd64.tar.gz" -C /usr/local/bin/ && \
   rm "sensu-go_${SENSU_VERSION}_linux_amd64.tar.gz"
   # Configure sensuctl
   sensuctl configure --non-interactive --namespace default --api-url http://127.0.0.1:8080 --username ${SENSU_USERNAME} --password ${SENSU_PASSWORD}
   ```

1. **Pre-seed the Sensu API with sample data.**

   ```shell
   sensuctl create -f data/sample.yaml
   ```

   Verify that the sample data was created using the following commands:

   - Run the `sensuctl namespace list` command.

     You should see output similar to the following:

     ```shell
     $ sensuctl namespace list
          Name
     ───────────────
       default
       development
       production
       staging
     ```

   - Run the `sensuctl entity list` command.

     You should see output similar to the following:

     ```shell
     $ sensuctl entity list --all-namespaces
             ID         Class      OS                       Subscriptions                              Last Seen
     ───────────────── ─────── ────────── ───────────────────────────────────────────────── ────────────────────────────────
       db01             agent   linux      system/linux,workshop,devel,entity:28b2d129bd90   2021-08-05 17:02:56 -0700 PDT
       app0             proxy   Workshop   entity:learn.sensu.io                             N/A
     ```

1. **Create a Sensu API Key.**

   - Generate a Sensu API Key using the `sensuctl api-key grant admin` command:

     ```
     $ sensuctl api-key grant admin
     Created: /api/core/v2/apikeys/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
     ```

   - Add the API Key to the `.env.local` file provided in this repository:

     Copy the API key output from the `sensuctl api-key grant admin` command (the `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx` part of the output) to the `.env.local` file

     ```ruby
     REACT_APP_API="http://127.0.0.1:8080"
     REACT_APP_KEY="xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
     PORT=7678
     ```

1. **Install the ReactJS project dependencies & start the sample app.**

   ```bash
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

   Verify that you have successfully completed the installation by visiting [http://127.0.0.1:7678](http://127.0.0.1:7678) in your browser.
   If you see a message like "connected to cluster running 6.4.0" then you have successfully completed this setup.

1. **Good luck & have fun!**

### Docker Compose Installation

Coming soon... PRs welcome! 😅
